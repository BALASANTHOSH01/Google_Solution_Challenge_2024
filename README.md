## Goal :

- Our mission is to centralize valuable agricultural resources, making the lives of farmers significantly easier. Despite the incredible advancements in modern technology, many agricultural practices remain rooted in tradition.

- Farmers often lack awareness of newly introduced seeds and their associated benefits due to limited access to agricultural experts.

- Through the Agro Assistant platform, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging modern technology to connect farmers with agricultural experts. 

- This connection will empower farmers to adopt contemporary techniques and methods, revolutionizing their agricultural practices.

## Identifying Problem :

- Human needs are basic, including essentials like food, water, air, shelter, and clothing. Despite a global population in the billions, a significant portion of the world's population lacks access to sufficient food.

- Agriculture plays a pivotal role in addressing this issue, as farmers cultivate crops such as rice, wheat, millets, and more.

- Unfortunately, many farmers continue to rely on traditional agricultural practices, unaware of modern methods, technologies, and seeds that could enhance their productivity. The reasons behind this knowledge gap are multifaceted.

### Reason :
#### 1. Limited Learning Channels: 
- Currently, there are limited avenues for farmers to learn about new agricultural methods directly from experts or institutions.

#### 2. Lack of a Comprehensive Platform:
- There is a notable absence of a single, comprehensive platform offering valuable resources such as agricultural training, news, expert interaction, and networking.

#### 3. Media Focus:
- Mainstream media tends to overlook agricultural topics, with a majority of people consuming news related to entertainment and technology.

#### 4. Online Information Gap:
-  Agricultural news and resources are scarce on both mainstream and social media platforms. Many individuals lack access to online platforms providing agricultural training, news, and connections.
